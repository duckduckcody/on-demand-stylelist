cookies vs location storage
  local storage only on client side, 5mb vs 4096 bytes
  cookies good if they are needed for server request as they are automatically sent with each request
    might be better to use local storage as limit and websites are only used on one api path
save theme selection to local storage
move limit and websites to local storage
